This project is part of BIG DATA FOUNDATION NANODEGREE PROGRAM. This project taught me a lot about the data analysis and mapper and reducer program. This project is completed using Python. Knowledge about Pandas , Numpy , Matplotlib is required. For reference you can look documentation and various online video lectures on Udacity and DataCamp, which was usefull in my term.
